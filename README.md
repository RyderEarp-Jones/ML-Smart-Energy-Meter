# Smart Energy Meter with ESP32 & Machine Learning

This project combines embedded systems and machine learning to create a smart energy meter capable of identifying which household appliance is currently active based on its power consumption signature. An ESP32 reads voltage/current data from a non-intrusive current sensor (CT clamp), publishes it via MQTT, and receives predictions from a machine-learning classifier. The result is displayed on an OLED screen and can also be integrated into platforms like Home Assistant.
